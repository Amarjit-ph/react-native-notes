# REACT NATIVE NOTES
My Personal Notes on React-Native using Mark down

React Native has a bright future. Because it is not only supported by Facebook but a huge community of developers.<br/>
According to the StackOverflow developer's survey, 2019 React Native lovers are almost 62.5%<br/>
From the earlier releases to the latest version, React Native has seen a kind of evolution.

<br/>
Yes, there are many new rivals in the market, such as Flutter and Cordova, trying to take their position.<br/>
But the framework can build brilliant applications, and Facebook is working hard to ensure that it doesn't become obsolete.

Personally, I have migrated my learning experience into Flutter<br/>
Have a great day Folks!
